# Programming Principles and Practice using C++

Exercises and code from the book [`Programming principles and practice using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup`](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html).

I have made this repository pubic to motivate me to continue and complete the exercises within the book and to hopefully help me understand programming and C++ more fully. I also wanted to improve my documentation skills by writing more markdown (even if no-one will read it).

I give no warrenty with the code in this repository, that it works or is free from errors. The code presented here is mostly directly from the book in cases of the examples and drills. Where the files are labeled as exercises, it is my own solution to the posed problem.

## 1. Dependencies

To compile C++ code you need a C++ compiler. As the book is written for the C++11 and C++14 standards it is recommended that you use a compiler which is compatitable with the C++11 and C++14 standards.

## 2. Folder Structure

There are 27 Chapters within the book, of which chapter 1 does not include any code examples or coding exercises so it is not listed as one od the folders.

Each folder in the repository contains three different type of C++ files. Those labeled as `example` are the sample codes used in the book (with possibly some minor modifications or comments where I saw fit). Files with the prefix `drill` are the suggested drills. As Bjarne suggests, you have not read the book unless you have done all the included drills and some of the exercises.  Lastly the files with `exercise` in the name are the problems to solve at the end of each chapter.

Each file is also numbered successively restarting at 1 with each chapter, and given a name indicative of the task the program is doing or the concept it is teaching.

## 3. Programs

Here I will detail the exercises I completed from the different chapters of the book and what they teach. Each program should be easy to understand from its source code with the comments I have included, but I have decided this will give an easy overview without opening each individual file. As I work through the book, I may decide to include additional markdown files within the respective chapers for notes on more advanced concepts.
